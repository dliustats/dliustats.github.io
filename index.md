I received my Ph.D. in Statistics (Biostatistics) under Dr. [Wenqing He](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/wenqing-he.html) at Western University. I am also a member of the GW-DSRG research team under Dr. [Grace Y. Yi](http://fisher.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yyi/) and Dr. [Wenqing He](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/wenqing-he.html) at Western University.

My research areas focuses on developing statistical methods to correct the measurement error/misclassification in dynamic treatment regimes. I am also researching on interactive data visualization and descriptive analysis in the COVID-19 data application.
